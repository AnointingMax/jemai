/**
 * One artist as the block both detail frames draw them: a 576 × 864 portrait
 * beside a 563px copy column, with an 81px gutter, on an unbroken 28px pitch.
 *
 * Each half is drawn only if that artist has it — a portrait with no biography
 * is a portrait, and a biography with no portrait runs on the full measure
 * rather than beside an empty box. An artist with neither never reaches here;
 * `artistNotes` has already dropped them.
 *
 * `showName` is off for a solo show, where the section heading and the credit
 * at the top of the page have already said who this is. `controls` is the
 * carousel's arrow pair on a group show, which sits under the biography it
 * advances rather than under the whole block.
 *
 * The portrait and the copy carry their own keys so a carousel advance fades
 * them and leaves everything around them mounted — including a `controls`
 * button somebody has their finger on, which a re-mounted subtree would drop
 * the focus of mid-click.
