/**
 * The block both detail frames close on. The frame draws one artist, because
 * the show it draws is a solo one, and that case is exactly what it was: a
 * portrait beside its copy, rendered on the server.
 *
 * A group show gets the carousel instead — one artist at a time under an arrow
 * pair — rather than a column of full-height portraits that would run the page
 * on for screens.
 *
 * An exhibition whose artists have nothing written about them has no notes at
 * all, and draws no heading: the caller checks the same emptiness to decide
 * whether its section rule is drawn.
